This is a Node.js / React / Redux / TypeScript project

It even uses some basic serverside rendering with React.

When you run the server and load localhost:3000, it should take you to

`localhost:3000/#home`

if you click the button on the page it will retrieve subreddits pertaining to ReactJS topics :)

It will also give you links back to Reddit if you care to read about posts on React!
